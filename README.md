### Available components and properties

* root `fake-content`
  * Bollean `animated` (default: true)
  * Bollean `rounded` (default: false) - border radius
  > properties from root component are automatically passed down to each yielded component, so they can be overriden whenever necessary per comoponent case


* yield `fake.heading`
  * Boolean `img` (default: false)


* yield `fake.text`
  * Number `lines` (default: 4)


* yield `fake.img`


* yield `fake.nav`

### Customization

Composable components make it easy to form a required module, but sometime it's not enough. If you'd like to also amend styling, there are few variables that you can help you out:

* `$ember-fake-content-primary-color` - darken background
* `$ember-fake-content-secondary-color` - light background
* `$ember-fake-content-border-radius` - if `rounded` property is set it sets the border radius
* `$ember-fake-content-line-height` - single line height
* `$ember-fake-content-spacing` - distance between lines
